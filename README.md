# logintest
I tried using mysql with python for the first time. It took a day, but I did it, and self-taught.

## test.py
A Non-GUI version of the program. Served as the bones behind the gui version.

## guitest.py
The GUI / Full version of this concept program. ( Well, concept for me at least, a python learner :p )

## MySQL Side of things.
Im using a local-hosted MariaDB installation on Arch Linux with a DB called logininfo, using the table "credentials" that holds the values:

+----------+----------+------------+                                                                                                    
| username | password | created    |                                                                                                    
+----------+----------+------------+                                                                                                    
| Joe      | password | 2016-09-07 |                                                                                                    
+----------+----------+------------+                                                                                                    

I'll post a tutorial on the wiki on how to set this up.

## How to install / use:
I'll post a tutorial on the wiki of this program on how to use it, if you want for example a base to start off, on a login program.
I am also planning to do a walkthrough of my messy code.
